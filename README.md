Branching is cool for the database here by neon.com. Thanks to technologies like: "copy-on-write" storage, branches share the same base and only store changes. 

Advantages: Fast and affordable. Instant to create branch and fast due to its own independent autoscaling compute endpoint (in the cloud).

Neon --> automatically scales down compute to zero when not being used saving costs and automatically (milisecond coldstarts) when activity comes back.

Branches are like github branches. They can easily made, deleted and merged.
